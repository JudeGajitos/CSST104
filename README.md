# **ACTIVITY 1**

# Description

This activity is all about Exploratory Data Analysis of Product Data. Wu used a dataset named hardwareStore.csv. We plot the distribution of products across categories, the analysis of cost and price, distribution of products in cities then the final part is the insight and reporting which is the summary of the activity program.

# **ACTIVITY 2 SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION**

# Description

In this activity of Simple Linear Regression, we used a dataset named Lesson_4_student_grades_dataset.csv. We visualize the data plotting the hours of study vs grades and previous exam score vs grades. Then prepare the data and make a linear regression mode. Then the last part is the visualization of the linear regression line.

# **ACTIVITY 3 MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION**

# Description

In this activity, we used the same dataset in the previous activity Lesson_4_student_grades_dataset.csv dataset. We use multiple independent variable then prepare the data for training and modeling for linear regression. Then get the mean squared error and make a prediction using the model.

# **ACTIVITY 4 LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

# Description

In this activity, we used the dataset named titanic_data.csv. We selected different features and one target in the dataset that we are going to use for logistic regression. Then processing the data by converting categorical value to numerical value. Split the data for training and testing set and create and train the logistic regression model. The last part is the prediction and the evaluation of the model.

# **EXERCISE 1**

# Description

This exercise is about data manipulation and data visualization. We use the dataset named sales_data_2.csv. In the data manipulation, we group the column product and revenue then compute the mean of quantity sold column. For data visualization, we plot the revenue by product using the bar graph.The last part is the report which is the summary of the program then saving the report to file text.

# **EXERCISE 2**

# Description

In this exercise, we created our own dataset named student_performance.csv. Next is the EDA or exploratory data analysis it consist of plots of distribution of test score, distribution of study hours, and scatter plot of study hours vs. test Score. Then various kind of data visualization and the last part is the report which is the summary stats.

# **EXERCISE 3**

# Description

This exercise is about multiple linear regression. We created a synthetic dataset with one hundred (100) rows and three (3) columns named Size, Bedroom, and Age. Then the value of y is another column which is the Price. Prepare the data for training then creating the linear regression model. The last part is making prediction, calculating the mean squared error and predicting the price of a new house.

# **EXERCISE 4**

# Description

This exercise is about logistic regression. We used the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. Then select features and target in the dataset and slit the data into training and testing set. We use StandardScaler() for standardize the features then train the logistic model. The last part is prediction on the test set and evaluating the model in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# **EXERCISE 5**

# Description

This exercise is about time series analysis and forecasting with ARIMA. We used sales-of-shampoo-over-a-three-ye.csv dataset then convert the month column into datetime datatype. There is a plot of shampoo over time for visualizing the time series. Decomposition plotting the sales of shampoo over a three year period. The last part is forecasting with ARIMA, fit a ARIMA model, and forecasting future values.

# **EXERCISE 6**

# Description

In this exercise, we have an objective it is to develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization. The dataset we used is onlinefoods.csv. It ontains information on online food orders, including customer demographics, order details, and feedback. The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, Monthly Income, and Feedback.

# **EXERCISE 7**

# Description

The objective of this exercise is to leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization. The "Netflix Userbase.csv" dataset, containing user demographics, subscription details, and other relevant information.

# **EXERCISE 8**

# Description

The objective of this exercise is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels. The dataset "most-polluted-countries.csv" contains several columns related to pollution and country characteristics for the year 2023. Here are some key columns in the dataset:. It Simulate a time series dataset for a country's annual pollution levels over 10 years. Assume a trend component, a seasonal component, and some random noise in the data.

# **EXERCISE 9 MIDTERM**

# Description

The objective of this exercise is to apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data. The dataset we used is Google Play Store Dataset, it contains information about the google play store.

# **Conclusion**

This is the compilation of my activities and exercises for the subject CSST 104 Advanced Machine Learning throughout the semester. The compilation consist of four (4) activities and nine (9) exercises.
